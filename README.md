This is the strategy we are going to employ first:


So what I would do is draw my own support and resistance and have the bot trade off my levels on a large timeframe
I would want the bot to trigger a trade when it hits a support. My profit line is 4x the size of my stop loss.
Meaning every win you get 4x of 1 loss.
Then I would include indicators like fibs and the 100 and 200 EMA.
I would look for trades around support, that are at the 50% FIB and above the 100 and 200 EMA
That would be a solid start because you're playing 50/50 with a support level but you're risking 4:1
